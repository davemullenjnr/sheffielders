<p>Inner City Weddings organise, style and coordinate <a href="https://www.innercityweddings.co.uk/our-weddings/">creative weddings and events</a> in independent venues, with local independent suppliers and creatives. They celebrate love in all forms, often in unlikely and 'non traditional' spaces.</p>

<p>The team love authentic, relaxed weddings in interesting spaces that focus on family and friends, great music, amazing food and dancing. They also take care to make sure that the art, design, and styling of an event complements the building they're in.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting that Inner City Weddings run the <a href="https://www.indieweddingfair.co.uk">Indie Wedding Fair</a>; an alternative wedding fair that supports small businesses, freelancers and the creative community.</p>
